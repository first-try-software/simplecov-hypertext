Hypertext formatter for SimpleCov
====================================

SimpleCov-Hypertext is a SimpleCov formatter that generates hyperlinked HTML files for your code coverage data. 

Forked from SimpleCov-HTML, which renders all of its output in a single HTML file. When run against large codebases, this can produce a single HTML file that is 100s of megabytes. Browsers have difficulty rendering HTML files that large. To solve that problem, SimpleCov-Hypertext creates one HTML file for every source file and a single index.html with links to them all.
